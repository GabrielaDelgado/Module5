# Module5
Challenge 5

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project is meant to look at a mice study in which tumors were measure at different timepoints and treated wth different drugs. Here, I looked at two datasets merged to get the number of subjects, eliminate the duplicates, create summary statistics tables, plots, and perform statistical analysis using quartiles, boxplots, and linear regressions. Plots and summary tables help with data visualization.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, the data sets, my code using Jupyter Notebook, and a document with my analysis of the data

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the Python code into the repository

VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

I used VS Code to be able to read the CSV files with the data to be analyzed. I imported the pandas and pathlib to be able to work with these datasets. And, matplot.lib to be able to make the graphs. First, since there are different timepoints for the same subject, I got read of the duplicates and created a new dataset. Then, I looked into the data and counted the number of subjects. After that, I made a summary statistics table, including the mean, median, variance, std, and SEM.

I created bar and pie charts to show the data. Later, I looked into the quartiles and possible outliers to plot a boxplot. I also added line and scatter plots. And finally, I looked created a linear regression and plotted the result.
